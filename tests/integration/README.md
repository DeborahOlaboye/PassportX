Integration tests for WalletConnect flows.

These tests are placeholders by default and require real WalletConnect wiring
and testnet credentials to perform actual end-to-end transactions.

Files:
- `walletconnect.integration.test.ts` - main scaffold
- `walletconnect.*.test.ts` - specific flow placeholders
- `helpers/walletConnectHelper.ts` - replace with real provider logic
